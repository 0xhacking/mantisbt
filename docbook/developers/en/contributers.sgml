	<para>
		MantisBT uses the source control tool <ulink url="http://git.or.cz">Git</ulink>
		for tracking development of the project.  If you are new to Git, you can
		find some good resources for learning and installing Git in the
		<link linkend="dev.appendix.git">Appendix</link>.

		<title>Cloning the Repository</title>

		<para>
			The primary repository for MantisBT is hosted and available in multiple
			methods depending on user status and intentions.  For most contributers,
			the public clone URL is
			<ulink url="git://mantisbt.org/mantisbt.git">git://mantisbt.org/mantisbt.git</ulink>.
			To clone the repository, perform the following from your target workspace:
		</para>

		<programlisting>
$ git clone git://mantisbt.org/mantisbt.git
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			If you are a member of the MantisBT development team with write access to
			the repository, there is a special clone URL that uses your SSH key to
			handle access permissions and allow you read and write access.  Note: This
			action <emphasis>will fail</emphasis> if you do not have developer access
			or do not have your public SSH key set up correctly.
		</para>

		<programlisting>
$ git clone git@mantisbt.org:mantisbt.git
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			After performing the cloning operation, you should end up with a new
			directory in your workspace, <filename>mantisbt/</filename>.  By default,
			it will only track code from the primary remote branch, <code>master</code>,
			which is the latest development version of MantisBT.  For contributers
			planning to work with stable release branches, or other development
			branches, you will need to set up local tracking branches in your
			repository.  The following commands will set up a tracking branch for the
			current stable branch, <code>master-1.1.x</code>.
		</para>

		<programlisting>
$ git checkout -b master-1.1.x origin/master-1.1.x
		</programlisting>
