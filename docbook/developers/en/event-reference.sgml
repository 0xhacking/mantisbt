		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>
			In this chapter, an attempt will be made to list all events used (or planned for later use)
			in the Mantis event system.  Each listed event will include details for the event type, when
			the event is called, and the expected parameters and return values for event callbacks.
		</para>

		<para>
			Here we show an example event definition.  For each event, the event identifier will be listed
			along with the <link linkend="dev.events.types">event type</link> in parentheses.  Below that
			should be a concise but thorough description of how the event is called and how to use it.
			Following that should be a list of event parameters (if any), as well as the expected return
			value (if any).

		<title>Plugin System Events</title>

		<para>
			These events are initiated by the plugin system itself to allow certain functionality to 
			simplify plugin development.

			<title>EVENT_PLUGIN_INIT (Execute)</title>

			<blockquote>
			<para>
				This event is triggered by the Mantis plugin system after all registered and enabled
				plugins have been initialized (their <code>init()</code> functions have been called).
				This event should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be the first event triggered for any
				page load.  No parameters are passed to hooked functions, and no return values are
				expected.
			</para>

			<para>
				This event is the first point in page execution where all registered plugins are 
				guaranteed to be enabled (assuming dependencies and such are met).  At any point 
				before this event, any or all plugins may not yet be loaded.
			</para>

			<para>
				Suggested uses for the event include:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Checking for plugins that aren't require for normal usage.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Interacting with other plugins outside the context of pages or events.</para></listitem>
