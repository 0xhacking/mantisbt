		<title>Building a Plugin</title>

		<para>
			This section will act as a walkthrough of how to build a plugin, from the
			bare basics all the way up to advanced topics.  A general understanding of
			the concepts covered in the last section is assumed, as well as knowledge
			of how the event system works.  Later topics in this section will require
			knowledge of database schemas and how they are used with Mantis.
