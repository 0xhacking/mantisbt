		<title>Building a Plugin</title>

		<para>
			This section will act as a walkthrough of how to build a plugin, from the
			bare basics all the way up to advanced topics.  A general understanding of
			the concepts covered in the last section is assumed, as well as knowledge
			of how the event system works.  Later topics in this section will require
			knowledge of database schemas and how they are used with Mantis.

			<title>The Basics</title>

			<para>
				This section will introduce the general concepts of plugin structure,
				and how to get a barebones plugin working with Mantis.  Not much will be
				mentioned yet on the topic of adding functionality to plugins, just how to
				get the development process rolling.

				<title>Plugin Structure</title>

				<para>
					The backbone of every plugin is what Mantis calls the "basename", a
					succinct, and most importantly, unique name that identifies the plugin.
					It may not contain any spacing or special characters beyond the ASCII
					upper- and lowercase alphabet, numerals, and underscore.  This is used
					to identify the plugin everywhere except for what the end-user sees.
