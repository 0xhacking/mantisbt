The MantisBT Entity-Relationship Diagram
========================================

The diagram was built using MySQL Workbench [1] version 5.2.40. The MantisBT
schema was reverse-engineered based on a freshly installed database, then the
relationships between tables and corresponding cardinalities were manually
added.

Editing Recommendations
-----------------------

* Make sure that the tables are big enough to display all columns
* Position the tables to minimize the number of intersections between the
  relationships lines (not always easy as the software does not offer much
  flexibility for positioning the connectors).
* Prior to saving the file, update the MantisBT and Schema version numbers in
  the 'Title' note (top-left corner); particularly, do not forget to bump the
  revision number.


Exporting
---------

To save the diagram in a more widely readable format:

  * Start MySQL Workbench and open mantisbt.mwb
  * Go to File / Export
  * Select Export as PNG, SVG or Single Page PDF

Recommended naming convention for exported files:

    mantisbt_VVV_SSS_erd_rR.XXX

where

  * VVV is the MantisBT version (e.g. 1.2)
  * SSS is the corresponding schema version (e.g. 183)
  * R indicates the diagram's revision number
  * XXX is the file's extension (e.g. pdf, png)
