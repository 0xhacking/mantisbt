        <title>History</title>
        
        <para>Kenzaburo Ito and a friend originally created a bugtracker
            as an internal tool for their pet project. A search for good, free
            packages came up with nothing suitable so they wrote their own.
            After a rewrite and cleanup it was made available to the public via
            the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL was chosen partly
            because of his belief that development tools should be cheap or
            free.In 2002, Ken was joined by Jeroen Latour, Victor Boctor and
            Julian Fitzell to be the administrators and the core development
            team of Mantis. This marks a new era in Mantis lifetime where it is
            now a team project.

            <title>What is it?</title>
            <para>Mantis is a web based bugtracking system. It is
                currently in development and is considered a beta.It is written in
                the 
                <ulink url="http://www.php.net/">PHP</ulink>
                scripting language and requires a
                <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</ulink>
                database and a webserver. Mantis has been installed on Windows,
                MacOS, OS/2, and a variety of Unix operating systems. Any web
                browser should be able to function as a client. It is released

                <title>Goals</title>
                
                <para>The goals for this project are to produce and maintain a
                    lightweight, simple bugtracking system. Additions of
                    complexity/features are modular so that users can be shielded from
                    unwanted clutter. Thus, much of the package has a simple version of
                    a feature along with a more fully developed version.In the 'core'
                    package the goal is to have the most important, most used, most
                    time saving portions of a bugtracking system. The product is
                    designed to be easily modifiable, customizable, and upgradeable.
                    Anyone with intermediate PHP and MySQL experience should be able to
                    customize Mantis to suit their needs.GuidelinesHere are some of the
                    guidelines that are followed in Mantis:

                <para>The release numbering convention we use is
                    major.minor.micro (eg. 0.15.8).Major - Indicates a very large
                    change in the core package. Rewrites or major milestones.Minor -
                    Significant amount of feature addition/modification. Anything that
                    requries an ugprade script.Micro - Mostly bug fixes or minor
                    featuresWe will release a new version for a significant bugfix as
                    often as daily.Currently, Mantis is considered beta software.
                    Version 1.0.0 will be used when we consider Mantis to be production
                    quality. This means it should be feature full and stable enough for
                    full production use.

            <title>Minimum Requirements</title>
            
            
            <para>Mantis runs on Windows, MacOS, OS/2, Linux, Solaris, the
                BSDs, and just about anything that supports the required server
                software.Mantis has modest software and hardware requirements. You
                need a computer to run the server software. All of the required
                software is free for commercial or non-commercial use.The computer
                can be a shared public web server or a dedicated co-loc box. It can
                even run on an office machine. Any Pentium class computer should be
                adequate for moderate usage. You'll just need enough diskspace for
                the database to grow and enough memory to avoid virtual memory
                thrashingDiskspaceMantis requires about 6MBs of diskspace for file
                storage. MySQL will require additional diskspace to store the
                issues. A typical installation with 2,000 issues and light file
                upload usage should take up around 10-20MBs of disk space.
                Attachments will inflate the size required according to their
                size.

            <title>Cost</title>
            
            <para>Mantis is free. The net cost to use Mantis is the time to
                download, install, and configure the software plus any potential
                hardware costs. Continued maintenance should be minimal unless you
                are tweaking the package.TimeIf you've done this sort of thing
                before it will probably take about 5-60 minutes. If not, plan on
                around 1-8 hours depending on the problems you run into. If you're
                unlucky then plan on more, or just give up now *wink*.PHPYou don't
                have to know a thing about PHP to use Mantis, unless something goes
                wrong. Then it helps to be able to tinker with PHP scripts (when
                there's a little bug or you want to tweak something).PHP is a
                simple scripting language and syntacticaly resembles C. It is very
                easy to pickup and learn. In fact, it makes normally difficult
                tasks so ridiculously easy that you'll want to use it for lots of
                simple tasks (like washing dishes).The
                <ulink url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</ulink>
                is phenomenal. If you ever have a question
                about a PHP function then run to it. The user comments always shed
                light into issues that others like you have experienced.There are
                many sites that offer basic tutorials for learning PHP and/or MySQL
                (

                <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/doc/">MySQL.com</ulink> has
                excellent documentation. It is also highly recommended to use
                <ulink url="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</ulink>
                to administer your MySQL database. You can create a new database
                and edit tables with this excellent package. All you need to do
                beforehand is setup the database user(s).WebserverThe webserver
                needs to be configured to handle PHP files. In Apache, this
                monumental task requires all of one line in the configuration file.
                There are also instructions for IIS, iPlanet/Netscape, Xitami, and
                more. All listed at the

        <title>About the Name</title>
        
        
        <para>When initially seeking to name this project Ken ran into a
            problem every programmer encounters. What is a good name?It has to
            be descriptive, unique, and not too verbose. Additionally having
            multiple meanings would be a nice touch or the perceptive.Quickly
            ruled out were php*Something* names which, incidentally, although
            popular, do not seem to be condoned by the PHP Group
            developers.Drawing inspiration from Open Source projects like
            Apache, Mozilla, Gnome, and so forth resulted in two eventual
            choices: Dragonfly and Mantis. Dragonfly was already the name of a
            webmail package. So the name became Mantis.Praying Mantis are
            insects that feed primarily on other insects and bugs. They are
            extremely desirable in agriculture as they devour insects that feed
            on crops. They are also extremely elegant looking creatures.So, we
            have a name that is fairly distinctive and descriptive in multiple
            ways. And that is how the project was named.
