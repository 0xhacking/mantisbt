        <title>What is MantisBT?</title>

        <para>
            MantisBT is a web based bug tracking system that was first made
            available to the public in November 2000.  Over time it has matured
            and gained a lot of popularity, and now it has become one of the most
            popular open source bug trackering systems.  MantisBT is developed 
            in PHP, with support to multiple database backends including MySQL,
            MS SQL, PostgreSQL and DB2.
        </para>

        <para>
            MantisBT, as a PHP script, can run on any operating system that
            is supported by PHP and has support for one of the DBMSes that
            are supported.  MantisBT is known to run fine on Windows, Linux,
            OS/2, System i and a variety of Unix operating systems.

        <title>Minimum Requirements</title>
            
        <para>
	    MantisBT has modest software and hardware requirements. It
	    requires a computer that is able to run the server software.  All of the required
            software is free for commercial or non-commercial use.  The
	    server can be a shared public web server or a dedicated co-located box. The
	    disk space required will depend on the size of the database,
	    however, it is typically driven by the expected number and size of
	    the attachments.

                <para>Operating System: MantisBT runs on Windows, MacOS, OS/2, Linux, Solaris, the

        <title>How to get it?</title>

        <para>
            MantisBT is available in several Linux distributions
            including: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, Frugalware and others.
            Hence, if you are running Linux, start by checking if your distribution
            has a package for MantisBT.  If not, or if the package is
            not up-to-date with the latest MantisBT version, then you may want
            to download it directly from
            <ulink url="http://www.mantisbt.org/download.php">here</ulink>.
        </para>

        <para>
            For Windows, Mac and other operating systems, use the link provided
            above to download MantisBT.  The download is compressed in tar.gz 
	    or zip format.  Both formats can be unpacked using tools like
	    <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</ulink> (in case of Windows).
        </para>


        <para>
	    Note that at any point in time there are typically two "latest"
	    MantisBT releases that are available for download.  The latest
	    production release (stable), and the latest development release
	    which can be an alpha or a release candidate.  It is not recommended
	    to use development releases in production specially if it is still
	    in the alpha stage unless the administrator is familiar with PHP
	    and is able to troubleshoot and fix any issues that may arise.

        <title>About the Name</title>

        <para>
	    When initially seeking to name this project Ken ran into a
            problem every programmer encounters. What is a good name?  It has to
            be descriptive, unique, and not too verbose.  Additionally having
            multiple meanings would be a nice touch.  Quickly
            ruled out were php*Something* names which, incidentally, although
            popular, do not seem to be condoned by the PHP Group
            developers.  Drawing inspiration from Open Source projects like
            Apache, Mozilla, Gnome, and so forth resulted in two eventual
            choices: Dragonfly and Mantis. Dragonfly was already the name of a
            webmail package. So the name became Mantis.  Praying Mantis are
            insects that feed primarily on other insects and bugs. They are
            extremely desirable in agriculture as they devour insects that feed
            on crops. They are also extremely elegant looking creatures.  So, we
            have a name that is fairly distinctive and descriptive in multiple
            ways.  The BT suffix stands for "Bug Tracker" and distinguishes
	    this project from general usage of the word Mantis.  However, over
	    time the project was typically referred to as Mantis.

        <title>History</title>

        <para>Kenzaburo Ito and a friend originally created a bug tracker
            as an internal tool for their pet project. A search for good, free
            packages came up with nothing suitable so they wrote their own.
            After a rewrite and cleanup it was made available to the public via
            the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL was chosen partly
            because of his belief that development tools should be cheap or
            free. In 2002, Ken was joined by Jeroen Latour, Victor Boctor and
            Julian Fitzell to be the administrators and the core development
            team of MantisBT. This marks a new era in MantisBT lifetime where it is
            now a team project.

        <title>Goals</title>
                
        <para>The goals for this project are to produce and maintain a
            lightweight, simple bugtracking system. Additions of
            complexity/features are modular so that users can be shielded from
            unwanted clutter. Thus, much of the package has a simple version of
            a feature along with a more fully developed version.  In the 'core'
            package the goal is to have the most important, most used, most
            time saving portions of a bug tracking system. The product is
            designed to be easily modifiable, customizable, and upgradeable.
            Anyone with intermediate PHP and MySQL experience should be able to
            customize MantisBT to suit their needs.  Here are some of the
            guidelines that are followed in Mantis:

   <section>
        <title>Cost</title>
            
        <para>
	    MantisBT is free. The net cost to use MantisBT is the time to
            download, install, and configure the software plus any potential
            hardware costs. Continued maintenance should be minimal unless you
            are tweaking the package.  If you've done this sort of thing
            before it will probably take about 5-60 minutes.  If not, plan on
            around 1-8 hours depending on the problems you run into. You don't
            have to know a thing about PHP to use MantisBT, unless something goes
            wrong. Then it helps to be able to tinker with PHP scripts (when
            there's a little bug or you want to tweak something).  PHP is a
            simple scripting language and syntacticaly resembles C / C++. It is very
            easy to pickup and learn.  The
            <ulink url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</ulink>
            is a great reference for any PHP related issue. The user comments always shed
            light into issues that others have experienced.  There are
            many sites that offer basic tutorials for learning PHP and/or MySQL
            (
