    <para>Following are the steps to upgrade a Mantis installation:See
        <ulink url="manual.installation.upgrading.html">Upgrading</ulink>.The
        following details the basic steps for installation on any system.
        Theinstructions may seem unix-centric but should work fine on
        Windows systems.Barring complications, it should take you about
        10-20 minutes to install,configure, and be using Mantis.

                        method you likebest (ftp, scp, etc). You will need to telnet/ssh
                        into the server machine forthe next steps.

                        usual command is (1 step):
                        tar zxvf &lt;filename.tar.gz&gt;
                        OR (2 steps):

                        rename the directory to something simpler like'mantis'. You will
                        use the mv command to rename a directory (Windows userssubstitute
                        the "ren" command or use explorer).

                                    pair can also beprovided. The operating user requires SELECT,
                                    INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETEprivileges. For installation, INDEX,
                                    CREATE, ALTER, and DROP privileges arealso required.

                                    Use this when you first login to Mantis. Immediately go to Manage
                                    and create at least one administrator level account. Immediately
                                    after that DISABLE or DELETE the administrator account. You can
                                    recreate it but you should delete the account to prevent the
                                    cookie_string from being used to trick the package. It would be
                                    even better to rename the account or delete it permanently.
                                    REMEMBER: After setting up the package, REMOVE the default
                                    administrator account.

            <title>Backups</title>
            
            
            <para>It is recommended to backup your Mantis database on a
                regular basis. This is easy to accomplish using the mysqldump
                command:
                mysqldump -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; &lt;database
                name&gt; &gt; &lt;output file&gt;
                To restore a backup you will need to have a clean database. Then
                run:
                mysql -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; &lt;database name&gt;
                &lt; &lt;input file&gt;
                You can also perform both of these tasks using
                <ulink url="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</ulink>
                A good idea is to make a backup script and run it regularly through
                cron or a task scheduler (for Windows see
                <ulink url="http://www.wincron.com/">WinCron</ulink>
                ).
                Using the current date in the filename can prevent overwriting and
                make cataloguing easier.
                !!! Backups should always be performed before an upgrade !!!
                Make sure to backup Mantis code (which includes your configs +
                possibly customization), bug attachments / project documents, and
                database contents.

            <title>CVS Integration</title>
            
            
            <para>CVS integration allows Mantis to register commits to the CVS
                source control system into corresponding bug notes in the issue
                tracker.The setup requires that the mantis installation be
                accessible on the computer running the CVS server. A copy of the
                Mantis config_inc.php file must be present.Note that the mysql
                database also needs to be accessible from the cvs machine. That is,
                "localhost" for $g_hostname won't work unless CVS and Mantis are
                hosted on the same machine.To activate the integration, the
                following line to the cvs "commitinfo" file. (Instructions to edit
                this file are in any number of CVS primers).
                ALL /usr/bin/php /path_to_mantis/core/checkin.php
                This will pass the commit message to checkin.php for all commits.
                If the stringissue #nnnn is found in the commit message, the Mantis
                corresponding to "nnnn" will have the CVS commit message added as a
                bug note to the issue. Multiple issues can be listed.This feature
                is configured through config_inc.php and through custom
                functions.

                It is recommended that you make an backup in case you wish to use
                your data in the future. See the

                If you have the permissions to create/drop databases and you have a
                specific database for Mantis that does not contain any other data,
                you can drop the whole database.
