### Installation steps ###

*** REQUIREMENTS: mysql database, php 3.0.7+, a webserver (tested on Apache,
should work with IIS or anything else php will run with).

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver.  You will need to telnet/ssh
into the server for the next stpes.

2. Next, untar/gzip it to the directory that you want.

3. After that you will need to cd into the directory and locate the
db_generate.sql file.  Run the following command:

mysql -u<username> -p<password> <databasename> < db_generate.sql

You could also cut and paste the sql statements from db_generate.sql into
a package like phpMyAdmin.  You will need to have created the database
ahead of time.

* WARNING: A DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR level account is created.  The account name
and password are administrator / root.  Use this when you first login to
Mantis.  Immediately go to Manage and create at least one administrator level
account.  Immediately after that DELETE the administrator account.  You can
recreate it but you should delete the account to prevent the cookie_string
from being used to trick the package.  It would be even better to rename the
account or delete it.  REMEMBER: REMOVE the default administrator account.

4. Now edit config_inc.php and set the appropriate variables.  In particular
you will want to set the database variables.  hostname, username, password, and
database name must be set to match the configuration of your webserver and
mysql database.

5. If you require .php extensions (instead of .php3) run the convertToPHP4 script.
You will probably need to first run "chmod +x convertToPHP4" to make the script
executable.

The script will rename all the .php3 files to .php.  Next you need to edit the
config_inc.php file and change $g_php = ".php3" to be ".php"

That should be it.  You're off and running.  For some help on custom editting
of the site (including renaming the database tables) please read the
CONFIGURATION file.  You'll probably want to add more bug catgories which
is covered in CONFIGURATION.
