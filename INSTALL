### Installation steps ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** REQUIREMENTS: mysql database, php 3.0.7+, a webserver (tested on Apache,
should work with IIS or anything else php will run with).

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver.  You will need to telnet/ssh into
the server for the next stpes.

2. Next, untar/gzip it to the directory that you want.

3. After that you will need to cd into the directory and locate the
db_generate.sql file.  Run the following command:

mysql -u<username> -p<password> <databasename> < db_generate.sql

You could also cut and paste the sql statements from db_generate.sql into a
package like phpMyAdmin.  You will need to have created the database ahead of
time.

* WARNING: A DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR level account is created.  The account name
and password are administrator / root.  Use this when you first login to Mantis.
Immediately go to Manage and create at least one administrator level account.
Immediately after that DELETE the administrator account.  You can recreate it
but you should delete the account to prevent the cookie_string from being used
to trick the package.  It would be even better to rename the account or delete
it permanently.  REMEMBER: REMOVE the default administrator account.

4. Now edit config_inc.php and set the appropriate variables.  In particular you
will want to set the database variables.  hostname, username, password, and
database name must be set to match the configuration of your webserver and mysql
database.

5. If you require .php extensions (instead of .php3) run the convertToPHP4
script.  You may need to first run "chmod +x convertToPHP4" to make the script
executable.

The script will rename all the .php3 files to .php.  You also need to edit the
config_inc.php file and change $g_php = ".php3" to be ".php"

NOTE: If your server sends .php files in plain text you're going to need to do
some heavy editing.  Basically you'll need to rename all the .php files to .php3
and then do a search and replace in every single file to rename core_API.php to
core_API.php3, and rename config_inc.php to config_inc.php3 in the core_API
file... and the same for all the other affected files.  If you don't do this
then anyone can access your database information (and delete it).

That should be it.  You're off and running.  For some help on custom editting of
the site (including renaming the database tables) please read the CONFIGURATION
file.  You'll probably want to add more bug catgories which is covered in
CONFIGURATION.

### Upgrading ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the files: UPGRADING and db_upgrade.sql

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Troubleshooting ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you ran the upgrade steps (UPGRADING) if you run into new problems
after installing a new version.

* PROBLEM:  Warning: Undefined index: MANTIS_STRING_COOKIE in config_inc.php
on line 197 (and similar warnings)

SOLUTION: Your error_level is too high.  Open up your php3.ini (or php.ini)
and lower it.  There should be enough comments around the variable to help you
out.

* PROBLEM: Cannot login.  It just redirects me to the login page with no errors
or messages.

SOLUTION 1: You may have track_vars set to Off (or 0).  Set this to On in your
php3.ini or (php.ini) file.  As of version 4.0.3 it is permanently set to On.

SOLUTION 2: You may not have DES installed on your system.  As a direct
result the crypt() funtion may not work properly.
