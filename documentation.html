<h2>Introduction and background</h2>

<p>
This is the Mantis user and system documentation.  Configuration and customization will be covered in another document
<p>

<h2>Part 1: Index</h2>

Each major section is partitioned via the menu.  Every section is treated as a page; some pages have multiple subsections or purposes.

<h2>Part 2: Pages</h2>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=login>[ Login ]</a></h3>
<p>
This is the login page.  Just enter your username and password and hit the login button.  There is also a <u>Save Login</u> checkbox to have the package remember that you are logged in between browser sessions.  You will have to have cookies enabled to login.
<p>
If the account doesn't exist, the account is disabled, or the password is incorrect you will be forwarded to a re-login screen.
<p>
The administrator may allow users to sign up for their own accounts.  If so a link to <a href="#signup">Signup</a> for your own account will be available.
<p>
Sessions will probably not be used for some time.  PHP3 does not support sessions and, since it is still very widely used, we will not be using sessions.
<p>
You will specify the project you want to have selected when you login.  You can easily change this later on from inside the package.

<blockquote>
<h4><a name=signup>[ Signup ]</a></h4>
<p>
Here you can signup for a new account.  You must supply a valid email address and select a unique username.  Your randomly generated password will be emailed to your email account.
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=main>[ Main ]</a></h3>
<p>
This is the first page you see upon logging in.  It shows you the latest news updates for the bugtracker.  This is a simple news module (based off of work by Scott Roberts) and is to keep users abreast of changes in the bugtracker or project.
<p>
The number of news posts is controlled by a package global.  When the number of posts is more than the limit a link to show "older news" is displayed at the bottom.  Similarly a "newer news" is displayed when you have clicked on "older news".

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=view_bugs>[ View Bugs ]</a></h3>
<p>
Here we can view the bug listings.  The page has a set of viewing filters at the top and the bugs are listed below.
<p>
<h5>Filters</h5>
<p>
The filters control the behavior of the Bug List.  The filters are saved between browsing sessions but do not currently save sort order or direction.  In order from left to right is:

<ul>
	<li>category
	<li>severity
	<li>status
	<li>show - show only XYZ bugs
	<li>changed(hrs) - highlight threshold for updated column.  6 means highlight (in bold) all bugs updated within the last 6 hours.
</ul>

<p>
If the number of bugs exceeds the "Show" count in the filter a link for the "Next XYZ" bugs will be displayed at the bottom.  Appropriate "Prev XYZ" bug links will also be displayed.
<p>
<h5>Bug List</h5>
<p>
The bugs are listed in a table and the attributes are listed in the following order: id, number of bugnotes, category, severity, status, last updated, and summary.  Each (except for number of bugnotes) can be clicked on to sort by that column.  Clicking again will reverse the direction of the sort.  The default is to sort by id in descending order.

<p>
<i>*** Suggested feature</i>: <u>Use glyphs to show sort direction</u> :
<blockquote>
A little glyph/bitmap would be a good way to indicate which column the bugs are being sorted by and in what direction.
</blockquote>

<p>
The bug id is made into a link that leads to a more detailed report about the bug.  Depending on what you have set in your <a href="#change_preferences">Account Preferences</a> you will be sent to the simple or advanced view.  You can also <a href="#add_bugnote">add bugnotes</a> here.
<p>
The number in the bugnote count column will be bold if a bugnote has been added in the specified time frame.
<p>
The text in the "Severity" column will be bold if the severity is major, crash, or block and the bug not resolved.
<p>
The text in the "Updated" column will be bold if the bug has changed in the last "Changed(hrs)" field which is specified in the viewing filters.
<p>
Each table row is color coded according to the bug status.  Here is an explanation of the default colorings:

<p>
<b>color coding</b>
<ul>
	<li>red: new - bug is new
	<li>purple: feedback - bug requires more feedback before work can proceed
	<li>orange: acknowledged - lets the user know that the bug has been examined but probably not by the proper developer
	<li>yellow: confirmed - bug has been confirmed by an updater or developer
	<li>blue: assigned - bug is currently being worked on by a developer
	<li>gray: resolved - bug is closed
	<li>light gray: resolved - bug is closed
</ul>

<p>
<b>severity</b>
<ul>
	<li>block - prevents further work/progress from being made
	<li>crash - crashes the application or OS
	<li>major - major bug
	<li>minor - minor bug
	<li>tweak - needs tweaking
	<li>text - error in the text
	<li>trivial - being nitpicky
	<li>feature - requesting new feature
</ul>

<p>
<b>status</b>
<ul>
	<li>new - new bugs
	<li>feedback - bug requires more information
	<li>acknowledged - bug has been looked at but not confirmed or assigned
	<li>confirmed - confirmed and reproducible
	<li>assigned - assigned to a developer
	<li>resolved - bug is closed
</ul>

<p>
<b>projection</b>
<ul>
	<li>redesign - needs a redesign
	<li>major rework - large amount of work
	<li>minor fix - shouldn't take a lot of time
	<li>tweak - done in a jiffy
</ul>

<p>
<blockquote>
<h4><a name=view_bug_simple>[ View Bug Simple ]</a></h4>
<p>
Here is the simple listing of the bug report.  Most of the fields are self-explanatory.  "Assigned To" will contain the developer assigned to handle the bug.  Priority is fully functional but currently does nothing of importance.  Duplicate ID is used when a bug is a duplicate of another.  It links to the duplicate bug which allows users to read up on the original bug report.
<p>
Users with an access level of Updater, Developer and Administrator can also <a href="#editing_bugs">Update Bug</a> or <a href="#delete_bug">Delete Bug</a>.  It is recommended against deleting bugs unless the bug is frivolous.  Instead bugs should be set to resolved and an appropriate resolution category chosen.
<p>
At the bottom of the bug report are any attached <a href="#bugnotes">Bugnotes</a>.  Only users with Viewer access are precluded from adding <a href="#bugnotes">Bugnotes</a>.
<p>
If the bug is resolved then there will be a <a href="#reopen_bug">Reopen Bug</a> button instead of an <a href="#add_bugnote">Add Bugnote</a> button.

<p>
<h4><a name=view_bug_advanced>[ View Bug Advanced ]</a></h4>
<p>
The Advanced View is much the same as the Simple View with a few additional fields.  Here you can see Projection, ETA, Votes (all which currently have no real effect), Platform, OS, OSBuild, Product Version, Product Build, and Steps to Reproduce.  There is also an <a href="#add_vote">Add Vote</a> button.
<p>
	<blockquote>
	<h4><a name=add_vote>[ Add Vote ]</a></h4>
	<p>
	This increases the vote tally.  There is currently no IP spam protection for vote adding.  The idea behind the vote counter is to have duplicate reports instead increase the vote count.  As the number of reports increase the relative importance of the bug becomes clear.  This is somewhat useful in prioritizing the order in which to give attention to bugs.  NOTE: currently voting is disabled while I figure out how to better utilize this feature.
	<p>
	</blockquote>
<p>
<h4><a name=view_reported_bugs>[ View Bugs Reported by Logged in User ]</a></h4>
<p>
This page shows looks just like the previous view all bugs page except that it only shows bugs that the logged in user has reported.
<p>
<h4><a name=view_assigned_bugs>[ View Bugs Assigned to Logged in User ]</a></h4>
<p>
This page is similar to the reported bugs page but only shows bugs that the logged in user is assigned to.
<p>
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=editing_bugs>[ Editing Bugs ]</a></h3>
<p>
These options are only available to Updaters, Developers, and Administrators.
<blockquote>

<h4><a name=update_bug_simple>[ Update Bug Simple ]</a></h4>
<p>
Here you can update various bug fields.  The Category, Severity, and Reproducibility fields are editable but shouldn't be unless there is a gross miscategorization.
<p>
Also modifiable are the Assigned To, Priority, Projection, ETA, Resolution, and Duplicate ID fields.
<p>

<p>
<h4><a name=update_bug_advanced>[ Update Bug Advanced ]</a></h4>
<p>
Projection and ETA are the only current fields that are unique and modifiable to Update Bug Advanced.
<p>

<h4><a name=assign_bug>[ Assign To Me ]</a></h4>
<p>
If you are a developer you can use this as a one click assign to me.  This saves you 3 clicks and a page load.
<p>


<h4><a name=resolve_bug>[ Resolve Bug ]</a></h4>
<p>
This option on the <a href="#view_bug">View Bugs</a> page allows you to resolve the bug.  It will lead you to a page where you can set the resolution state and a duplicate id (if applicable).  After choosing that the user can choose to enter a bugnote detailing the reason for the closure.
<p>


<h4><a name=delete_bug>[ Delete Bug ]</a></h4>
<p>
This option on the <a href="#view_bug">View Bugs</a> page allows you to delete an existing bug.  This should only be used on frivolous or test bugs.  A confirmation screen will prompt you if you really want to delete the bug.
<p>
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=bugnotes>[ Bugnotes ]</a></h3>
<p>
Everyone except Viewers can add and delete bugnotes.  If the bug is closed then you cannot <a href="#add_bugnote">Add Bugnotes</a>.  You will have to <a href="#reopen_bug">Reopen Bug</a> before you can add another bugnote.  Only administrators and the original bugnote poster may delete the bugnote.
<p>
<blockquote>
<h4><a name=add_bugnote>[ Add Bugnote ]</a></h4>
<p>
Type in what additional notes.  Line breaks are preserved (converted to &lt;br&gt;) and no html is allowed.
<p>
<h4><a name=delete_bugnote>[ Delete Bugnote ]</a></h4>
<p>
Just click on the Delete link to remove an unwanted bugnote.  There is no confirmation screen.
<p>
<h4><a name=reopen_bug>[ Reopen Bug ]</a></h4>
<p>
If the bug is currently resolved you can use this to reopen the bug.  Then you will be allowed to enter bugnotes.  You will be sent to a page where you can enter a bugnote for the reason to reopen the bug.  The bug will automatically be put into Feedback status.
<p>
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=report_bug>[ Report Bug ]</a></h3>
<p>
Here you can report new bugs.  Depending on your <a href="#change_preferences">Account Preferences</a> you will be sent to the advanced or simple report forms.  Newly reported bugs are, naturally, put into the new bug status.

<p>
<blockquote>
<h4><a name=report_bug_simple>[ Report Bug Simple ]</a></h4>
<p>
The simple form lets you report the category, reproducibility, severity, summary, description, and additional information category.  All but Additional information are *required* fields.
<p>
Summary should be a short, one sentence description of the problem.  It has a limit of 128 characters.
<p>
<blockquote>
<h5><a name=category>[ Category ]</a></h5>
<p>
Select the most apprpriate category for the report.  These categories are defined per project by the project administrator
<p>
<h5><a name=reproducibility>[ Reproducibility ]</a></h5>
<p>
Reproducibilty is the key to being able to quickly fix a bug.
<ul>
	<li>always
	<li>sometimes
	<li>random
	<li>have not tried
	<li>unable to duplicate
</ul>
<p>
<h5><a name=severity>[ Severity ]</a></h5>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>block - prevents further work/progress from being made
	<li>crash - crashes the application or OS
	<li>major - major bug
	<li>minor - minor bug
	<li>tweak - needs tweaking
	<li>text - error in the text
	<li>trivial - being nitpicky
	<li>feature - requesting new feature
</ul>
<p>
<h5><a name=summary>[ Summary ]</a></h5>
<p>
A brief one line description of the problem
<p>
<h5><a name=description>[ Description ]</a></h5>
<p>
A detailed description of the problem
<p>
<h5><a name=steps_to_reproduce>[ Steps to Reproduce ]</a></h5>
<p>
List the detailed steps to reproduce a problem.  This is useful for bugs that take a while to show up or tricky cases.  It would be best to use a format that looks like
<p>
1. step 1<br>
2. step 2<br>
3. step 3
<p>
<h5><a name=additional_information>[ Additional Information ]</a></h5>
<p>
Anything extra information that you didn't put into the Description should go here.
<p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<h4><a name=report_bug_advanced>[ Report Bug Advanced ]</a></h4>
<p>
The advanced form has, of course, more fields to fill in than the simple version.  It has, in addition to the simple form fields, an option to choose between choosing an existing <a href="#manage_profiles">Account Profile</a> or filling in the computer platform, operating system, and operating system version/build, product version, product build, and steps to reproduce.  You may optionally directly assign a bug to a developer.
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=summary>[ Summary ]</a></h3>
<p>
This shows a detailed summary of the state of the bugtracker according to several (hopefully) useful metrics.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=account>[ Account ]</a></h3>
<p>
This page allows the user to change his username, email, and password.  It also has subsections to Manage Profiles and Change Preferences.  If an admin has "protected" the account then the user is not allowed to change his username, email or password.  This is to allow single access public accounts (like a guest account).

<blockquote>
<h4><a name=manage_profiles>[ Manage Profiles ]</a></h4>
<p>
Here you can add new profiles.  This is useful when you don't want to keep re-entering your system configuration in the <a href="#advanced_bug_reports">Advanced Bug Reports</a>.  It allows for multiple bug reports for multiple system configurations.  There is a "Description" field as a catchall for more details
<p>
You can also edit, set different profiles to be defaults and delete profiles.  To reset profiles to have no default just select the blank profile and choose "Make Default".

<p>
<i>*** Suggested feature</i>: <u>User specified fields</u> :
<blockquote>
It would be really useful for projects to be able to tailor what their reporting needs would be.  This would also be reflected in the <a href="#advanced_bug_reports">Advanced Bug Reports</a> section.
</blockquote>

<p>
<h4><a name=change_preferences>[ Change Preferences ]</a></h4>
<p>
This page allows the user to specify which page (simple or advanced) will be the default page when viewing a bug and reporting a bug.  You can reset the defaults with the "Reset Prefs" button.
<p>
Future user level default preferences will be implemented here.
<p>
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=manage>[ Manage ]</a></h3>
<p>
This section is reserved exclusively for administrators.  The main Manage page shows a list of users and their relevant info.  Username, email, access level, enabled status, protected status, date created, and last visit.  From here the admin can choose to edit the user's info.  If people can signup for accounts and the admin chooses to reset the users information the user's password will be randomly generated and emailed to the user.  If users canot signup for accounts the password will be set to be blank.
<p>
Also available are <a href="#create_account">Create Account</a>, <a href="#projects">Projects</a>, and <a href="#documentation">Documentation</a>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name=create_account>[ Create Account ]</a></h4>
<p>
Create a new account in this section.  Default is to have the account enabled and set to reporter.  Currently this does *not* send an email to the user.

<p>
<h4><a name=projects>[ Projects ]</a></h4>
<p>
Projects are handled from this section.  You will see a listing of each project as well as an Add Project form at the top of the page.  You can edit the categories and versions of a project by clicking on the Edit link.  If a project is marked private it will be hidden from non-developers.  Disabled projects are hidden from all but administrators.  The status of a project can also be selected (development, release, stable, obsolete).  The description currently is only displayed in this section.
<p>
In the edit project section you can update the project information, delete the project, or add versions and categories.  You can also update and delete the versions and categories.
<p>
Remember to add at least one category for your project!!!  Otherwise, you won't be anle to enter bug reports.

<p>
<h4><a name=documentation>[ Documentation ]</a></h4>
<p>
This is just a page with hard coded links to ChangeLog, README, INSTALL, UPGRADING, and CONFIGURATION.
<p>
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=edit_news>[ Edit News ]</a></h3>
<p>
Developers and administrators are allowed to make news posts from this section.  These posts show up in the <a href="#main">Main</a> section.
<p>
Enter a headline and then the post.  Line breaks will be preserved (converted to &lt;br&gt; tags).  Do not put " in the headline.  It will be converted to a ' if you do.  This is because it screws up the Edit Post drop down list.
<p>
You will also select the project that the post will be posted to.  You can select a sitewide post if you wish the news item to appear on every single news page.
<p>
At the bottom you can either edit the selected post or delete it.  Default action is to edit the post.  You will be taken to a screen where you can edit the post.  If you choose delete then you will be taken to a page requiring delete confirmation.

<p>
<i>*** Suggested feature</i>: <u>Allow limited HTML in news posts</u> :
<blockquote>
Allow certain HTML tags in news post body.  Specifically &lt;A&gt;, &lt;B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;U&gt;, and &lt;LI&gt;
</blockquote>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=logout>[ Logout ]</a></h3>
<p>
This deletes the user cookie and redirects the user to a specified page (default is to redirect to the index page which redirects the user to the <a href="#login">Login</a> page)

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
<h3><a name=docs>[ Docs ]</a></h3>
<p>
This shows this documentation file.
