### Troubleshooting ###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you ran the upgrade steps (UPGRADING) if you run into new problems
after installing a new version.

* PROBLEM: Cannot login.  It just redirects me to the login page with no errors
or messages.

	SOLUTION 1: You may have track_vars set to Off (or 0).  Set this to On in
	your php3.ini or (php.ini) file.  As of version 4.0.3 it is permanently set
	to On.

	SOLUTION 2: You may not have DES installed on your system.  As a direct
	result the crypt() funtion may not work properly.  If possible install DES
	encryption support for your operating system.

	SOLUTION 3: You do not have require_globals enabled. Set this to on in
	your php.ini file.

* PROBLEM: I get warning messages when I post bugnotes.  Everything seems fine
but the errors happen everytime I post a bugnote.

	SOLUTION: The error is harmless. There was a bug in the pre 0.14.0 versions
	of Mantis where account preferences were not properly created.  To fix it
	go to your Account and click on Change Preferences.
