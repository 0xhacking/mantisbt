Mantis rewrite.

Goals:
-o 	No loss of current functionality
-o 	No loss of current ease of use
-o 	No loss of current ease of setup
-o	Make/keep source files clean, consistent, easy to read,
	and not unnecessarily long
-o 	Designed with security in mind

Primary:
-o 	Database abstraction via ADODB (http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB)
    Get rid of core_database_API.php
-o	Every "user operation" API function checks permissions before
	performing it's operation.  It would be nice if this was done
	by calling one function that could obtain all the state information
	(current user, current project, current bug, whatever...) so that
	more complex and customized rules could be developed later.  The
	basic idea is let something else decide whether the operation is
	allowed, not the API function itself.
	(Why not? Doesn't it complicate it things if you move the rules	elsewhere?)
-o	Common functions to deal with INPUT, OUTPUT, STORAGE, etc.
    -o Input? Isn't that just $_* and core_config_API.php?
	-o Output? You mean like core_html_API.php et al?
	-o Storage? As in ADODB's library?
-o	Use $_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST/$_COOKIE/$_SERVER
-o	Consider moving configs to db.
-o  Create core_config_API.php, with configuration access functions.
-o  Move all core/function files to a seperate directory

Secondary:
-o	Source documentation via phpdoc (or similar)
    -o phpDoc (phpdoc.de)
	-o phpDocumentor (phpdoc.org)
-o	Are there any DB schema cleanups that could be done while we're
	making major changes anyway?  Might be a good time to justify
	one big change if necessary (not sure if there is, just throwing
	it out there to think about)
	-o We can update the version to use an index, while we're at it?

What else?
