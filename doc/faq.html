<div class="faq-category">1. General</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_1_1" />1.1 I want to change or add or remove some of the META tags.</dt>
<dd>Edit the <span class="file">meta_inc.php</span> file.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_1_2" />1.2  I want the project to change automatically when I select it!</dt>
<dd>This is enabled via Javascript.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_1_3" />1.3 Will you integrate Mantis into &lt;insert favorite CMS or framework&gt;?</dt>
<dd>No.  At some point we may consider unified login capabilities but that would be the extent of the integration.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_1_4" />1.4 Will you port Mantis to Perl/Java/Ruby/Python?</dt>
<dd>We have no plans to port to &lt;insert language&gt;.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_1_5" />1.5 What is Mantis?</dt>
<dd>Mantis is a php/MySQL/web based bug tracking system. It is free for all to use and is distributed under the conditions of the GNU GPL.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_2" />
<div class="faq-category">2. Configuration</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_2_1" />2.1 Can I use Mantis with multiple virtual servers?</dt>
<dd>Up to version 0.17.x, you can run Mantis through the different virtual servers, however, it will use the same database and configuration.<br />
<br />
As of version 0.18.x, Mantis can be setup to run on multiple virtual servers using a different database / configuration depending on the host in the URL.  This can be achieved by defining the environmental variable <span class="variable">MANTIS_CONFIG</span> to point to a Mantis config file that will be loaded after <span class="file">config_defaults_inc.php</span> and <span class="file">config_inc.php</span>.  This file should include all the virtual server dependent configuration.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_2_2" />2.2 Can I run Mantis on a different http port, like 1080?</dt>
<dd>Just access Mantis through the URL you need to run on that port.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_2_3" />2.3 How can I use Mantis with SSL?</dt>
<dd>Just access Mantis via the https:// protocol.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_3" />
<div class="faq-category">3. Customization</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_3_1" />3.1 Can I add custom fields to Mantis?</dt>
<dd>The possibility to add custom fields is implemented in Mantis 0.18.x releases.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_4" />
<div class="faq-category">4. Appearance</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_4_1" />4.1 How do you change the date format?</dt>
<dd>You can do that through the following config options: <span class="variable">$g_short_date_format, $g_normal_date_format, $g_complete_date_format</span>.  For more details about the format to use see the online PHP documentation for function <span class="function">date()</span>
<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_2" />4.2 What are these @null@ values that I'm seeing?</dt>
<dd>Release 0.15.0 converted the ENUM values to INT in order to achieve full localization. As a result these INT values index into an array which corresponds to their actual text. If the value stored in the database has no textual match then @null@ is displayed.  This indicates that there is a mismatch between the stored value and corrseponding string.<br />
<br />
Release 0.18.x would show @number@ for database values that are not found in the enumeration.  So if database value 10 was not found in the enum, Mantis would show @10@ as a result (rather than @null@ in previous releases).<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_3" />4.3 The tables are all centered in IE6.</dt>
<dd>This issue has been fixed.  Please upgrade to a newer version of Mantis.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_4" />4.4 I want to change some of the CSS.</dt>
<dd>Edit the <span class="file">css_inc.php</span> file.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_5" />4.5 I want some nice graphs when I look at bug stats.</dt>
<dd>There is preliminary support available via the JpGraphs package. You will need to download and install the package and enable use in <span class="file">config_inc.php</span><br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_6" />4.6 I want to have a custom company logo at the top of every page</dt>
<dd>This is undergoing a rewrite.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_7" />4.7 I want to see a listing of bugs sorted by reporter (or assignee).</dt>
<dd>You can filter the bug listing to only show bugs reported by a specified user.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_8" />4.8 Can I set my own colors?</dt>
<dd>Yes, however, the procedure is currently undergoing revision.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_4_9" />4.9 I want to have the menu bar at the bottom as well as the top of each page.</dt>
<dd>Enable this by toggling the <span class="variable">g_show_footer_menu</span> global.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_5" />
<div class="faq-category">5. Database</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_5_1" />5.1 Why did you pick MySQL?</dt>
<dd>The main reasons for using MySQL were that is ubiquitous, runs most anywhere, and is extremely simple. I fully realize how it is almost laughable when compared with 'real' databases like Oracle. Other databases will be supported as resources become available. This will likely happen around the 2.0.0 release.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_5_2" />5.2 How do I backup the MySQL database?</dt>
<dd>Run the mysqldump command and pipe the output to a file. <br />
<br />
<div class="code">
mysqldump -u[username] -p[password] [database] &gt; [output filename] <br />
</div>
<br />
To import, just run: <br />
<br />
<div class="code">
mysql -u[username] -p[password] [database] &lt; [input filename] <br />
</div><br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_5_3" />5.3 I need support for PostgreSQL/Oracle/MSSQL</dt>
<dd>Other's have managed to hack ports to other databases, but we will not be devoting any resources to database porting until Mantis is feature complete.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_5_4" />5.4 I need transactions!</dt>
<dd>Probably not. In any case, MySQL is not in a position to support these by default anytime soon. It seems to have served the Mozilla project just fine.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_5_5" />5.5 When will Mantis have Database Abstraction?</dt>
<dd>Sometime in the future. It will probably make use of the ADODB or PEAR::DB package.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_6" />
<div class="faq-category">6. Email</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_6_1" />6.1 I don't want all developers to recieve email from projects they aren't a part of.</dt>
<dd>You should set each project to be private and raise the access threshold to above developer. Then manually add each user that you want into that project. Alternatively, you can add the developer to a project and 'demote' his access level.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_6_2" />6.2 When is email notification sent out?</dt>
<dd>Email notification can be sent out on the following events <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>A NEW bug is reported</li>
<li>A BUGNOTE is added</li>
<li>A bug is set to ASSIGNED</li>
<li>A bug is set to FEEDBACK</li>
<li>A bug is set to RESOLVED</li>
<li>A bug is set to CLOSED</li>
<li>A bug is REOPENED (FEEDBACK)</li>
</ul><br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_6_3" />6.3 The email validation isn't working correctly. How can I fix this?</dt>
<dd>You can disable the email validation by toggling the config variable in config_inc.php. You can try to just disable the mx record check, which checks to see that the domain supplied has a valid mail record, or also disable the email format validation check.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_6_4" />6.4 Why does it take a really long time for a report to get submitted? Everything else is pretty responsive.</dt>
<dd>The most likely cause is that the email system isn't properly configured. Take a look at your settings and your mail server and make sure that everything is functioning correctly.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_6_5" />6.5 I forgot my password. How can I have it automatically emailed to me?</dt>
<dd>Currently you cannot since the encryption process is one-way. That means your password is relatively secure but cannot be recovered. You will need the administrator to reset your password.<br />
<br />
If email is enabled then the password is recreated and emailed. Otherwise it is set to blank.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_7" />
<div class="faq-category">7. Encryption</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_7_1" />7.1 I don't have crypt() installed. Can I run Mantis?</dt>
<dd>Yes! Previously you could not. Now you can choose to use MD5 or plaintext. MD5 is similar to crypt() but should be supported across all PHP platforms. Like crypt it is also one-way so you cannot retrieve the original password. Plaintext is self-explanatory. Just remember that anyone who can read the database can read your password, so don't pick a critical password!<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_7_2" />7.2 I'm getting this error message: Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function crypt() in core_user_API.php on line 134</dt>
<dd>All builds of PHP4 and up are supposed to have crypt() built-in. However, due to some errors the 4.0.5 and possibly the 4.0.6 builds do not have this built-in. This applies to Windows in particular but also to several other platforms (OpenBSD, etc.) <br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_8" />
<div class="faq-category">8. Errors</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_8_1" />8.1 Can I move existing bugs to other projects?</dt>
<dd>Yes.  From the View Bugs page, tick the checkboxes next to the bugs you want to move, then select the project to move to from the combo-box at the button.  Clicking OK, will then ask you to specify the project to move to.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_8_2" />8.2 I am unable to upload documents or attach files to bugs.</dt>
<dd>Check the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Check that configuration option <span class="variable">$g_allow_file_upload</span> is set to ON.</li>
<li>Check that upload_tmp_dir option in php.ini has write access to internet user.</li>
<li>Check that the extension of the file you are trying to upload is not one of the disallowed extensions defined by <span class="variable">$g_disallowed_files</span>.</li>
<li>Make sure that the file size is not too big to the database/disk space/max uploaded file size. (put more details here)</li>
</ul><br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_8_3" />8.3 I'm getting the following error: Warning: Missing argument 5 for print_manage_user_sort_link() in /usr/local/share/doc/apache/mantis/core_print_API.php on line 548. I'm using Mantis 0.15.3</dt>
<dd>Change the last argument in the function call to $p_hide=0<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_8_4" />8.4 I'm getting this error message: Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function XYZ in ABC.php on line 123</dt>
<dd>Your particular build of PHP does not have these functions builtin. You may have to upgrade or recompile to fix these errors. In some cases, Mantis has global variables that can disable the usage of these functions. Particularly problematic functions are crypt(), is_uploaded_file, getmxrr().<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_8_5" />8.5 Running Windows. Warning: unexpected error in date() in c:\program files\nusphere\apache\htdocs\mantis\manage_page.php3 on line xxx</dt>
<dd>This is a result of an error in Windows/PHP when the date is all zeroes. Of course, the date should never be all zeroes so that's a bug on Mantis' part. It should be fixed. To quick fix you will need to run a sql query to update any time field that is equal to all zeroes to something non-zero.<br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_9" />
<div class="faq-category">9. License</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_9_1" />9.1 Why did you choose the GPL?</dt>
<dd>While I have no great love of the GPL it happens to best fit my personal beliefs and philosophy regarding the software. My personal belief is that development tools should be free for others to use. They are the ultimate tools of empowerment.<br />
<br />
As a side benefit I can freely import existing code from the great many other PHP based GPL packages without worry about license conflicts.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_9_2" />9.2 What license does Mantis use?</dt>
<dd>Mantis is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_9_3" />9.3 Doesn't the GPL mean that we have to make any customizations we make available to everyone else?</dt>
<dd>No. The GPL states that the source code needs to be available only to those you distribute the package. However, you cannot prevent those people from distributing the source. The important point is that if you never distribute Mantis you never need to make the source changes available. This includes customers who just visit the bug tracker to make a report. <br /><br /></dd>
</dl>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br /><br /><a name="#category_10" />
<div class="faq-category">10. Functionality</div>
<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_10_1" />10.1 I am not able to login to Mantis?</dt>
<dd>This is a common problem that sometimes occur with new installations.  The possible reasons are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Cookies are disabled (user is notified if this problem in version 0.18.0).</li>
<li>register_globals is set to OFF in <span class="file">php.ini</span>.  This problem only affects 0.17.x releases (or earlier)</li>
<li>The encryption technique in <span class="file">config_inc.php</span> is different from the one that was used to encrypt the password stored in the database.</li>
<li>CAPS lock is active.  Mantis passwords are case sensitive.</li>
<li>Account for the specified user name was disabled by the administrator.</li>
<li>Wrong user name or password.  New installations should use administrator / root.</li>
</ul><br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_2" />10.2 How can I view bugs across multiple projects at the same time?</dt>
<dd>Select &quot;All Projects&quot;.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_3" />10.3 Is there bug history logging in Mantis?</dt>
<dd>This was added in 0.18.x releases.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_4" />10.4 Does Mantis support file uploads?</dt>
<dd>Yes.  You can upload to disk or to database.  As of Mantis 0.18.x, you can also upload to an FTP server.  When files are uploaded to an FTP server, they are still stored on the webserver as well.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_5" />10.5 Can I rearrange which fields are available in the simple and advanced report forms?</dt>
<dd>Not unless you modify the code.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_6" />10.6 Does Mantis have target releases or milestones?</dt>
<dd>It is currently not planned to add these fields to Mantis.  According to user feedback, the development team found that users' needs are different in terms of fields to be added.  However, most of the users agreed that Mantis should not be overcomplicated with more and more fields.  Hence, it was decided to support such fields by adding Custom Fields support.  Thus, users will be able to define their own fields which can include these ones.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_7" />10.7 Can all bugs in a certain category automatically be assigned to a user?</dt>
<dd>Yes, each project:category combination has a user associated with it.  This user has to have a handler access level or more.  All defects that are added into this directory without being explicitly assigned, are automatically assigned to this user.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_8" />10.8 Does Mantis have fulltext searching?</dt>
<dd>There is a simple bug search but not a full search through all fields.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_9" />10.9 I want a nice quick way of linking to other bugs.</dt>
<dd>Just prefix a bug id with the # sign. So if you type #742 then it will automatically create a link to bug #742.  This prefix is defined in a system global.  You could set it to be bug:// or whatever you like.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_10" />10.10 Can I specify which fields are required?</dt>
<dd>Not unless you modify the code.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_11" />10.11 I'm getting permission denied errors uploading files in win2k.</dt>
<dd>Make sure the path is set properly in the project settings and that the folder has the proper security permissions.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have read permissions from the temp directory.  Otherwise the filesize will come out incorrect.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_12" />10.12 Can I customize the view bugs screen? I want to see more fields.</dt>
<dd>You can do this by hand if you know a little php and html but there is currently no browser-based method to do this.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_13" />10.13 I'd like a daily/weekly/monthly digest of events that have occurred.</dt>

<dt><a name="#item_10_14" />10.14 Why can't I sort by multiple sort keys?</dt>
<dd>The main reason is because there isn't a good way to do this given the current UI and code layout. Eventually a more complex query builder and advanced filtering interface will allow for this to happen.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_15" />10.15 Does Mantis support multiple projects?</dt>
<dd>Yes<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_16" />10.16 Can Mantis store user-created custom queries?</dt>
<dd>Not yet.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_10_17" />10.17 Does Mantis have graphs for showing bug statistics?</dt>
<dd>There is preliminary support in place. You will have to grab the  <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/jpgraph/">JpGraph package</a><br /><br /></dd>

<dt><a name="#item_11_1" />11.1 Does Mantis support other languages?</dt>
<dd>Yes. The localization files are stored as .txt files. All that is required to support a language is the translation of those language strings. <br /><br /></dd>

<dl>
<dt><a name="#item_13_1" />13.1 Do you require register_globals to be set to On?</dt>
<dd>Not anymore!  Mantis opperates as if register_globas is turned Off.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_13_2" />13.2 What are the minimum requirements?</dt>
<dd>Mantis requires a web server, PHP and MySQL. You will need PHP 4.0.6 or higher installed and compiled with MySQL support. You will also need a web server setup to process PHP scripts.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_13_3" />13.3 Could you use a flat file in place of a database?</dt>
<dd>No. You must have a database running to use Mantis<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_13_4" />13.4 Does Mantis require Javascript to be turned on?</dt>
<dd>No.  There are now some Javascript niceities but they degrade nicely when Javascript is turned off.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_13_5" />13.5 I don't use cookies. Can I still use Mantis?</dt>
<dd>No. You must enable cookies to use the package.<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><a name="#item_13_6" />13.6 Does this actually run on Windows?</dt>
<dd>Mantis is known to run on Windows NT and 2000 using a variety of web servers (IIS, Apache, Bad Blue, etc.). There are occasionally platform specific problems depending on the webserver used and the version of PHP.<br /><br /></dd>

<dt><a name="#item_14_1" />14.1 I can't use Mantis because it will infect all my software with the GNU GPL!</dt>
<dd>This is an incorrect myth that is being spread by various corporations that make their living off of proprietary software. The GPL will only come into play when you distribute your software which includes portions (or the entirety) of any other GPL software. You may make customizations all you want and never have to open your source as long as you never distribute the software that includes GPL code.<br /><br /></dd>
