Mantis grew out of my need for a simple and easily adaptable bugtracking
system.  I took a look at Bugzilla but I didn't like the interface and
complexity.  Also, I know php but barely know perl.

Originally this was written by a friend of mine but he has let me take over the
project entirely.  In any case I completely rewrote his code.  I attempted to
make the HTML fairly modular so people could easily dive into customization.

Security exists though I'm not really in a position to judge how secure.  Also
there are probably some basic checks that I haven't done (because I don't know
what to check for!).  So, if you're going to use this try to use it in a
semi-private area until this package has been looked through a few times.

Features:

- Variable controlled appearance
- Built-in category management
- Color coded status indicators
- Integrated news
- Integrated user management
- Integrated account management
- Projection / ETA
- Items updated since last visit indicators

The release numbering convention I'm using is major.minor.micro.
Major indicates a large change in the core package, minor a significant
amount of feature addition/modification, micro for mostly bug fixes.

I'd appreciate an email letting me know if you find this program useful.
I won't publish any information without permission, I'd just like an idea
and knowing I'm helping people will only motivate me more.

Also, let me know if you see any ways I can improve my code or design.
I'm by no means an expert in php or code design.
