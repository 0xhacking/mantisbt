Mantis grew out of my need for a simple and easily adaptable bugtracking
system.  I took a look at Bugzilla but I didn't like the interface and
complexity.  Also, I know php but barely know perl.

Originally this was written by a friend of mine but he has let me take over the
project entirely.  In any case I completely rewrote his code.  I attempted to
make the HTML fairly modular so people could easily dive into customization.

Security exists though I'm not really in a position to judge how secure.  Also
there are probably some basic checks that I haven't done (because I don't know
what to check for!).  So, if you're going to use this try to use it in a
semi-private area until this package has been looked through a few times.
