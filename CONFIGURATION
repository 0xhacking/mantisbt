This file contains information to help you customize Mantis.

* config_inc.php - this file contains all the site-wide variables.
  It is advisable to rename this to something else then change the
  require() statement in core_API.php to point to this new file.  This
  way you can easily upgrade your installations while not having
  to re-enter all your configuration settings.

  NOTE: since the package is still being changed a fair amount I suggest
  the following.  You configure the config_inc.php file but then rename
  it to something like my_config.php.  Then when you copy a new release
  over it will overwrite the config_inc.php.  Open up that file and
  at the very bottom put: include ("my_config.php");
  This way any new varaibles get setup and then your custom settings
  overwrite anything else.  After you get up and running you can go back
  and modify config_inc.php and then repeat the cycle.

* core_API.php - this file contains all the critical functions

* To add more categories just edit through the manage area.  The format must
  be separated by , and enclosed in ''.

  eg.  'bugtracker','other','display','core','loader'

* global variables are prefixed by g_
* parameters in functions are prefixed with p_
* form variables are prefixed with f_
* user related variables are prefixed with u_
* other variables are usually either prefixed with v_ or t_
* count variables usually have the word count in the variable name

* Each file checks to see if the user is logged in using
index_login_cookie_check() or login_cookie_check().  This is to prevent
unauthorized access.  This merely retrieves a cookie and matches it
against the stored user information.

* The files are split into three basic catgories, viewable pages,
include files and pure scripts. Examining the viewable pages (suffix _page)
should make the basic file format fairly easy to see.  The file names
themselves should make their purpose apparent.  I decided to break the
work into many small files rather than have a small number of really
large files.

* Most of the action scripts have a confirmation page to make sure the action
completed sucessfully.  To remove this step just add a
Header( "Location: <redirect_page_name>" ) command before the HTML begins.

* Edit css_inc.php to make your own page formatting.

* All files were editted with TAB SPACES set to 4.  I'm sorry if this causes
a problem, but I can't stand 8 and tabs are helpful.  I've tried to alleviate
this in the config file by using spaces for the most part.

****** A note on globals: globals are a rather quirky item in php.  Basically
all variables are always local in scope unless declared global.  This is why
some of the include() files have global deslarations in them.
